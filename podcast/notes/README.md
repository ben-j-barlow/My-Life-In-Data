# Notes

The notes I take are not intended to help another person understand the content of the podcast. They are merely for my benefit.

Nonetheless, you can guess my interests by observing which content I choose to take notes on.

Notes related to my personal relationships are not pushed to the repo (hence why file names stored here are not 1 to N).
