# Planet Normal: Not A Lot of Cop (27)

* Story of UK banning fracking to look green. Yet they import £300mn of American gas collected by fracking! Unbelievable! Discuss of Sunak’s green fairytale.
* Farmers: 3x average suicide rate. Pressure on fuel and fertiliser costs. Media and environmentalists against us. It’s tough. Need policies to support sustainable farming, rather than just pushing alternative meat and milks.
