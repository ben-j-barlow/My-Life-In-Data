# Lex Fridman: Ginni Rometty

CEO of IBM for 10 years.

* Most important trait during interview process: willingness to learn!
* "Growth and comfort never coexist" I disagree becasue you can seek growth rather than letting growth find you.
* Extreme empathy to those who have kids and work.
* Many people do not return to work after paternity leave because of lack of confidence in their ability to perform. IBM offered returnships (super flexible return to work opportunities with low expectations) and so many people who hadn't come back before decided to come back.
