This module is a first course in computer programming. This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
    
  Fundamentals of programming  
  Introduction to programming: Programming paradigms; From Specification through Algorithms to Implementation; Program compilation and testing. Building Elements: Preconditions and postconditions; Basic data types; Variables, identifiers and scope. Control structures: Conditionals; Case statements and loops; Correctness issues when programming with loops. Methods: Comparison between iteration and recursion. Object oriented programming  
  Programming with objects and classes: Complex data types; Parameter passing by reference and by value; Encapsulation. Arrays and strings Class inheritance: Dynamic binding; Multiple inheritance; Interfaces and abstract classes. Design, construction and testing  
  Program specifications Error handling Methods of testing Experience with the Java programming language Understanding of Data Types Iterative Statements Conditional Statements Imperative Programming Object Oriented Programming Inheritance Error Handling Passing by value vs passing by reference. Learning to thinking programatically and algorithmically and how to take a specification and turn it into a plan for a program. Coding Problem solving Communication skills (verbal) Critical thinking
