PH136 - Logic 1: Introduction to Symbolic Logic This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
    
  This module provides a study of formal logic, covering both propositional and first-order logic.  We will study formal languages, which will allow us to define precise notions of logical validity, and to develop methods to establish the validity or invalidity of arguments. In particular, we will introduce a system of proof (of the natural deduction kind) which can be used to establish that an argument is valid. We will also learn how to translate English sentences into formal language ones and vice versa. The module is based Barwise &amp; Etchemendy: Language, Proof and Logic (CSLI publications, Stanford) An understanding of the notion of logical validity and related logical notions.  Enhancement of the ability to articulate and evaluate arguments with clarity and precision by enhancing (a) the ability to identify and articulate structural logical relations between English sentences, and (b) the ability to detect and articulate structural ambiguities in English. Enhancement of analytic skills, in particular the ability to: (a) articulate ideas and arguments with clarity and precision, (b) analyse and assess complex reasoning, (c) pay careful attention to detail.
