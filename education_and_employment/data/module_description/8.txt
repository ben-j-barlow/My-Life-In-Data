The module runs in Term 2 and provides elementary introduction to the theory of probability. The topics include axioms of probability, combinatorics, independent events, conditional probability, random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, expectation and variance, joint probability distributions, independence of random variables, sum of independent random variables, covariance and correlation.  
  This module is core for students with their home department in Statistics and is not available to students from other departments. Students from other departments should consider ST111 Probability A and ST112 Probability B instead.
