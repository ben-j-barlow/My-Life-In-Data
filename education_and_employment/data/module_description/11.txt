Data structures and algorithms are fundamental to programming and to understand computation. The purpose of this module is to provide students with a coherent introduction to techniques for using data structures and some basic algorithms, and with the tools for applying these techniques to computational problems. This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
