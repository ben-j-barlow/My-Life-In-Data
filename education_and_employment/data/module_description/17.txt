This module runs in Term 2 and is core for students with their home department in Statistics. It is not available to other students who should consider ST220: Introduction to Mathematical Statistics as an alternative.  
  Prerequisite(s): ST218 Mathematical Statistics Part A Leads To: many ST3 and ST4 modules  
  
 Module web page This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
    
  The notion of a parametrized statistical model for data. The definition of likelihood and examples of using it compare possible parameter values. Parameter estimates and in particular maximum likelihood estimates. Examples including estimated means and variances for Gaussian variables. The repeated sampling principle: the notion of estimator and its sampling distribution. Bias and MSE. Examples of calculating sampling distributions. Fisher's theorem on Gaussian sampling. Construction of confidence intervals. Notion of a hypothesis test. Likelihood ratio tests. Neyman-Pearson Lemma. P-value. Examples including classic t-test, F-test. Principle of data reduction: sufficient statistics, and applications to point estimation and hypothesis testing. Asymptotic normality of MLEs. Examples. TBC Among others, ability to derive methods for standard point estimation, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals in different setting that the statistical models considered in the module, e.g., for linear models or for stochastic processes.
