This module runs in Term 1 and is core for students with their home department in Statistics and optional for students studying discrete mathematics. It may be possible for non-finalists from other courses to take this module as an unusual option subject to permission from the module leader and the home department.  
  This module has pre-requisites: MA106 Linear Algebra and MA137 Mathematical Analysis or equivalent.
