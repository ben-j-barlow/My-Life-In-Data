This module studies Data Base Management Systems (DBMSs): the science and technology for organising and retrieving large amounts of structures data efficiently. It presents in depth the Relational Model and the declarative language SQL and explains how it can be used  to define and interrogate databases. It also shows how to access databases from procedural programs (in Java and C). It discusses the formal underpinnings of Relational Databases, and Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus and how to optimally define the Database using relations/tables. Finally, it also discusses issues pertaining to security and physical data storage. This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
    
   Overview of databases and database management systems  The Relational Model and Relational DBMSs  The SQL declarative Programming Language  Programming DBs - using SQL from C and Java programs  Theoretical underpinnings: Normalisation theory, Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus  Security  Physical DB storage Understanding of:  
   data modelling within the relational model/DBs environment â€“ schema definition, logical DB design and the process of normalization for this goal;  declarative programming languages (SQL) as a data manipulation and data definition language and how to use SQL from procedural programming languages (C, Java);  formal languages for the relational model: Relational Calculus and Relational Algebra;  data security within the DBMS context, and  data storage Include:  
   data management for large-scale analytics  association of declarative and procedural languages and 2-/3-tier architectures for information systems  security issues at large
