This module provides an introduction to the theory and implementation of neural networks and an understanding of the important computational neural network architecture and methodology. It aims to give students sufficient knowledge to enable employment or postgraduate study involving neural networks. This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
    
  -Introduction: history of neural computing; relationship to Artificial Intelligence. -Neurons: structure and behaviour of biological neurons; simple models of neurons; nonlinear and dynamical models. -Networks of Neurons: how neuronal networks are arranged in the brain; common architectures for artificial networks. Coding and Representation: how information is represented in neural networks; place coding; distributed representations. -Learning and Memory: plasticity in biological neurons; theories of memory; learning in artificial networks. -Vision: structure of the human visual system; function of the retina, LGN and cortical processing; artificial network models for vision. tbc tbc
