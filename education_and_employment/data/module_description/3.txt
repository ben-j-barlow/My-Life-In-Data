At the end of the module students will be able to recognise, formulate and solve practical resource allocation and planning problems. Module members will also be able to identify the limitations of the approaches. This module serves as a prerequisite for further modules in integer and non-linear programming, which are available to students in their second and final years. This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
