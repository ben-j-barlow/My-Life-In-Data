The 3rd year project is an extended, individual piece of work which forms a core element of the Data Science degree. Students choose a topic and find a supervisor in the summer term of their 2nd year.  
  This module is not available to students from other departments. This is an indicative module outline only to give an indication of the sort of topics that may be covered. Actual sessions held may differ.
    
  Students select a project during Term 3 of the second year by submitting an outline of the proposed project and finding an academic member of staff to supervise it. A detailed project specification is submitted during the first term. A written progress report on the current state of the project is submitted later in the first term for 5% credit (combined with the specification). A presentation of the final results of the project is given to the assessors during the second term for 15% credit. A detailed written report of the project is submitted early in the third term for 80% credit. The project is not a taught module but a major design and development exercise for the student carried out under supervision. The individual project involves consolidating, combining and applying a wide variety of subject specific skills gained in the rest of the degree course so far. Technical - Technological competence and staying current with knowledge  Communication - Verbal, listening, writing, technical communication skills, using different medium for communicating  Critical Thinking - Problem-solving, analysis of possible solutions etc  Multitasking - Soft skills such as time management, organization skills etc  Creativity - Ability to harness creative ideas and turn them into tangible and strategic products/solutions
